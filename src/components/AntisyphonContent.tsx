              Initially, I was hired at Black Hills Information Security/Antisyphon Training as a software engineer.
              However, that role quickly evolved into conceptualizing our new website.
              <br /><br />
              I partnered with creative directors and design teams, as well as key stakeholders to create an intuitive
              experience for cybersecurity professionals.

              <br />
              Rather than creating just another static site that linked to third-party platforms, I envisioned an
              intuitive marketplace where users could seamlessly purchase any type of course through a shopping cart experience.
              <br /><br />
              This would allow us to offer a wide range of courses, from live events to on-demand training, all in one place.
              I also envisioned a system that would allow us to easily add new courses and manage existing ones.

              Using Figma, I designed over 50 wireframes, refining them through multiple rounds of discussion, feedback, and iterations.
              Since Black Hills Information Security was developing comics, I wanted the site to be both fun and user-friendly, with
              course badges that resembled in-game achievements.
              <br /><br />
              Once the wireframes were finalized, we hired <a href="https://www.frieddesign.co/" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>
                Fried Design</a>{' '}to craft a unique visual identity for the site, including achievement-style course badges.

                Starting with boilerplate WooCommerce and heavily customizing it, we built a seamless logged-in experience for user account management.
                <br /><br />
                This includes sections for Live and On-Demand courses, powered by API queries to track progress, generate certificates, and manage subscriptions.
                Since our third-party LMS identifies users by email address, we customized account management features to allow updates while clearly warning users of
                potential consequences.

              In addition to the consumer-facing site, Antisyphon Training also serves as a full-featured WordPress CMS, which required its own UX considerations.
              While design played a smaller role here, our focus was on making content administration fast, intuitive, and reliable.
              <br /><br />
              Using powerful plugins like The Events Calendar, Events Tickets Plus, and Advanced Custom Fields, we customized the admin experience, reducing
              course and content creation time by approximately 85%. This was all synced with a PHP/MySQL backend to ensure seamless integration with the LMS
              and generate reports.
              <br /><br />
              Surfacing API messages, generating unique IDs, and allowing admins to edit orders were just a few of the key features, much of which we built
              from scratch.
