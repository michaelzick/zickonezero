              <h2>Antisyphon Training</h2>
              <br />
              Initially, I was hired at Black Hills Information Securityâ€”Antisyphon Training as a software engineer.
              However, that role quickly escalated to conceptualizing what would be our new website.
              <br /><br />
              Not content with just making another static site that linked out to third-party platforms,
              I envisioned an intuitive marketplace for users to buy any type of course through a shopping cart experience.

          </div>
        </BioBox>

              <div>
                <h2>Intuitive Dashboards</h2>
                <br />
                Starting with boilerplate WooCommerce and customizing the **** out of it, we crafted a logged-in experience for user account maintenance.
                <br /><br />
                This involved creating sections for Live and On-Demand courses complete with API queries to retrieve completion data, serving certificates
                of completion, and allowing users to purchase, cancel, and renew Subscriptions.
                <br /><br />
                Of course, no user dashboard would be complete without a way for users to change their email, password, addresses, and see their purchase history.

              <h2>UX Design</h2>
              <br />
              Using Figma, I began designing wireframes that would go through several rounds of discussion, feedback, and countless iterations.
              <br /><br />
              When the wireframes were complete, we hired <a href="https://www.frieddesign.co/" target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer'>Fried Design</a>
              {' '}to give our site a unique look complete with game-like course badges.

              </div>

              <br /><br />
              <h2>Admin Experiences</h2>
              <br />
              In addition to the consumer-facing site, Antisyphon Training is also a full-featured WordPress CMS, which required its
              own UX considerations. While design played less of a role, we needed to make content administration fast, intuitive, and reliable.
              <br /><br />
              Using massive plugins like The Events Calendar, Events Tickets Plus, and Advanced Custom Fields, we customized and crafted an
              administrative experience that increased course and content creation by around 85%, all while syncing with a PHP/MySQL backend services
              layer to link everything correctly.
              <br /><br />
              Surfacing API errors, generating unique IDs, and allowing admins to edit orders were all part of the package.
