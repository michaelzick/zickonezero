                <h3>TL;DR (Executive Summary)</h3>
                <DemoStokeList>
                  <li><strong>What it is:</strong> A peer-to-peer platform where riders can demo gear from local owners.</li>
                  <li><strong>Problem:</strong> Riders want to try before they buy, but demos are rare, costly, and inconvenient.</li>
                  <li><strong>Solution:</strong> A location-based marketplace to safely connect riders and lenders.</li>
                  <li><strong>My Role:</strong> Founder, Product Lead, UX strategist, MVP architect.</li>

                <h3>The Problem</h3>
                <p>Demo opportunities for rideable gear are limited, inconvenient, or nonexistent. Many riders either blindly purchase expensive equipment or wait for infrequent on-site demos. Meanwhile, gear sits unused in garages, with no platform to connect owners and riders.</p>
                <DemoStokeList>
                  <li>“I want to try before I buy but there’s nothing around me.”</li>
                  <li>“Shops only have limited brands.”</li>
                  <li>“I don’t want to buy a $750 surfboard I’ve never ridden.”</li>
                  <li>“Demo days at the beach and mountain are few and far inbetween.”</li>
                  <li>“I need more people to try my boards but doing demo days takes me away from shaping.”</li>
                  <li>“It would be cool to have all available demos, no matter who they’re from, in one place.”</li>
                  <li>“Could I have the demo shipped to me so I don’t waste time picking it up?”</li>
                  <li>“Demo boards at the resort are expensive and they have a limited selection.”</li>
